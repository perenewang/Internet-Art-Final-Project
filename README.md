# Internet-Art-Final-Project
◕ ◞ ◕ This project was made using https://netnet.studio

When COVID first started, we were all in college, personally I was in my first year having a blast hanging out with my friends and going out downtown. But then we all were sent home and had stay at home quarantine orders for months! Now we could finally come back to school, but it's still a pandemic so we can't go out partying and we only just started being allowed to eat indoors. For this project I wanted to bring back the memories of going out and having fun so I wanted to create a "disco". The flashing lights (shapes) alternate colors and when clicked on the screen changes color and when clicked on again it goes back to just being the circles. Personally I really enjoyed the animations portion of this class so I wanted to include them and I wanted to create a fun atmosphere with the flashing colors and different shapes. I also wanted this project to have a more abstract feel to it. To further this project I want to make it so that when you click on a shape, it would play a random song (most likely EDM or some type of party music).
